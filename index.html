				<h3>Hi, my name is Thinh T. Diep</h3>
				<p>My RMIT ID: 3825459 <br>
					And my email: s3825459@rmit.edu.vn</p>
				<h4>And here's a little something about myself</h4>
				<p>I am from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. This is my first semester in RMIT Vietnam.
					I can speak Vietnamese and English. <br>
					Two facts about myself: I have been learning the violin for about a year; I also play video games
					competitively. The two games that I am currently playing the most are Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and
					Autochess Mobile.</p>

			<!-- Aspriations -->
			<article id="aspirations">
				<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/mmbn-background.jpg" alt="Megaman Battle Network" /></span>
				<h5>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?
					Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if
					any).</h5>
				<p>The above picture can sum up my inspirations and aspirations since childhood. </p>
				<p>The topic I find the most interesting in information technology and computer science is artificial
					intelligence, specifically natural language processing, humanlike robots and sentient AI. My
					interest in these topics started in my childhood. I used to play a video game series on my computer
					named <em>Mega Man Battle Network </em> (using a Gameboy Advance simulator). Those games have the
					players switch between playing as a young boy and his partner, a sentient AI human avatar in a
					computer world, and fight villains to save the world. In this game world, AI is an indispensible
					part of life and every person has a personal assistant similar to the aforementioned main character
					that helps with his or her daily life. They can even converse just like a human would and be a close
					friend. The games made a huge impact on me and ever since I have always wanted to make such a
					technology a reality. I am also a fan of books and movies that explore similar ideas, such as
					those from author <a
						href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36402034-do-androids-dream-of-electric-sheep">Philip
						K. Dick</a>
					and director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_(film)">Steven
						Spielberg</a>.</p>

				<h5>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h5>
				<p>RMIT is my top choice for a university in Vietnam for several reasons. Firstly, it is an
					English-speaking campus, where I can improve my English greatly, and English is an important
					skill that employers seek nowadays. Secondly, it has a large body of international students of
					different cultures and backgrounds whom I can learn from since they have different points of view.
					Thirdly, it is an international school whose programs are accredited by recognized organizations,
					which means my degree would be recognized in many places around the world should I choose to pursue
					a career in a different country than Vietnam.</p>
				<h5>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h5>
				<p>I have a few expectations for the course. I want to learn enough about the different topics within IT
					to be able to figure out what exactly I want to do in the future. I want to be able to have a clear
					view of my ideal job and have an idea of how to get there. I want to know that, for the career that
					I choose, whether that I should work after I graduate or I should pursue further education in form
					of a Honors Degree, Master Degree and/or PhD Degree. I want to learn where in the world I should go
					to have the best environment for my career. I want to explore a project that I am passionate about
					and have an idea of how to create it. I want to learn the skills or at least know what skills I need
					to learn to be able to do such a project. Lastly, I would want to reaffirm my interest in IT and
					computer science.

				<h4>
					<a href="https://jobs.lever.co/openai/588c1d80-4632-4d5c-a535-9f2c8c80c501">Job Posting</a>
					<p style="display: inline;"> (<a href="https://imgur.com/5yrtUEK">Alternate Link</a>)</p>
				</h4>
				<p>The position is a research position at OpenAI, a company whose mission is creating AI technology that
					are both open-source and beneficial to humankind. The ultimate goal of OpenAI is building artificial
					general intelligence (AGI), meaning AI that has the same capability of intelligence as humans. The
					company consists of many research teams focusing on different aspects of AGI. The job description
					itself is actually quite vague, but it still excites me for many reasons. Firstly, the company’s
					mission aligns quite close to the area of AI I want to focus on in my career e.g. humanlike
					conversational AI. Secondly, even though it’s a research position, it is a position in industry,
					instead of academia where there is a large degree of politics governing researchers. Thirdly, I
					myself want to build something that can be immediately useful to all people, rather than doing
					research and writing papers that are read by only a few people, and industry provides a better
					opportunity in doing this than academia.</p>
				<p>The skills, qualifications and experience as described in the posting is, again, quite vague.
					However, there is a few things that may be implied in the posting. AI is a field that requires high
					skill and education, and even more so for a researcher. Therefore, a PhD degree in computer science
					may be required, or at least a Master’s degree. They also want candidates to show a track records
					of authoring papers or projects. It is also mentioned that the company have a culture of creativity
					in AI. The projects that the company is pursuing are open-source, therefore ideal candidates would
					be those who have participated in such projects.</p>
				<p>At the moment, I am an undergraduate student at RMIT in the IT program. I have taken classes in
					programming and computer science and have gotten excellent grades in those classes. I have
					participated in a mentorship program where I have to do research within a team and done a
					presentation at the end. I am confident in my skills in programming and my skill to further learn
					subjects related to IT and computer science.</p>
				<p>In my opinion, the first step towards obtaining all that I need for the ideal job is to complete the
					RMIT Vietnam IT program with a high GPA. I aim to have a 4.0 GPA. During my time here at RMIT, I
					should participate in research and side projects that can showcase my skills and my interest in the
					AI field. After obtaining the Bachelor of IT, I will go to RMIT in Melbourne, Australia and study to
					get the Honors Bachelor of Computer Science. With that second Honors Bachelor, I will apply for a
					PhD program, perhaps in the United States or in an English-speaking country. During all this time, I
					will participate in more research and projects. I am also interested in the entrepreneur world,
					therefore building and making something of my own is something that I will constantly be doing.</p>

				</h3>
				<p><a href="https://imgur.com/xvQyEQV">Alternate Link</a></p>
				<h4>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h4>
				<p>For me, doing these tests and learning about myself is fun, but their usefulness might be limited to
					only a few contexts in career paths. The test results indicate that I’m most likely an ENTP
					personality type. One of the prominent traits in my type is that ENTPs are curious and like to come
					up with ideas. I think this trait can complement my career choice as an AI researcher very well.
					Since AI is a growing field, creative solutions and new ideas are essential. Furthermore, I think
					people of my personality type would also make great candidates as entrepreneurs, which is something
					that I am interested in as well.</p>
				<p>The learning styles, to me, however, is mostly a myth. It is largely useless to know what “my”
					learning style is, since different subjects require different ways of learning. It would be
					impossible to learn how to speak French by looking at charts; or learn carpentry by listening to a
					lecture. I think the most important thing is to figure out what is the best way of learning a
					subject and then do it. Sticking to your own learning “style” may be a self-fulfilling prophecy and
					limiting yourself from things that requires different skills.</p>
				<p>For my Big Five personality test, I find that the results mirror those in the MBTI test where applicable
					and there only a few minor new insights. I think that this is a good sign since it means that the
					results of my personality would be largely accurate if two different tests came out the same 
					way.</p>
				<h4>How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team?</h4>
				<p>As discussed above, I think that the learning style test is not very useful at all and the insights 
					from the Big Five personality test is similar to the MBTI test, I will mostly use the MBTI 
					results for the discussion in the following section.</p>
				<p>Having done the test, I have gained 
					some knowledge about what my strengths and weaknesses are, and I can use this information 
					to benefit the team. I think one of my best strengths is that I love to come up with new ideas. 
					This is something that I think I would constantly be using during the upcoming group assignments 
					(and in teams in general). There are many problems that would arise in the duration of a group 
					project, and those requires solutions, which is something I could see myself doing.</p>
				<p>More 
					importantly, knowing about my weakness help me realize that there are things I should pay more 
					attention to when working in a team. For example, while I prefer a logical debate to an emotional 
					one, some other personality types may not feel the same way, so I should pay more attention to 
					not step on others’ toes. According to the test, I may have a hard time realizing that sometimes 
					compromise is better than absolute truth, so within a team, I should be more attentive about 
					keeping members relaxed and happy.</p>
				<h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
				<p>For me, there are a few ideals when forming a team. Since I like to come up with ideas but 
					generally dislike implementing them, I would most likely want to recruit teammates who are 
					more task-oriented and good with details. I think I will likely be most comfortable being a 
					team leader so that I can be the one who will be looking at the big picture of a project, which 
					is something that my personality type enjoys doing. That being said, if I am a team leader, I 
					would also expect the other team members to come up with their own ideas and take ownership in 
					the work that they do, therefore I would love to work with those who have the same capability 
					for knowledge and learning as I do. In a team, I prioritize the mission the highest, which is 
					consistent with my personality since I tend to want to find the best logics in things. This is 
					something that I would not hesitate to let my teammates know, so my ideal teammates would be 
					those who are willing to put aside their feelings to achieve a common goal. With all these 
					being said, however, as I have discussed in the previous section, having happy teammates is 
					one of the most productive quality for a team, so I should take care and pay attention to my 
					teammates’ feelings and thoughts so that everyone can focus on the work itself.</p>

			<article id="project">
				<h2 class="major">Project Idea</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/project-banner.jpg" alt="Project Banner" /></span>
				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>For my project idea, I want to build a daily scheduling technology. The application helps you plan
					out your day to day life. A work-in-progress name for this application would be named
					<strong>Dayli</strong>. <strong>Dayli</strong> have an interface that let user allocate their plans
					with date and time, much like a calendar. What sets <strong>Dayli</strong> apart is that it will use
					AI technology to make plans and allocate time for important tasks for the user automatically. For
					example, <strong>Dayli</strong> can allocate time for the users based on their to-do list for the
					day. It continually learns from the user behavior to improve itself. <strong>Dayli</strong> can
					exist both as a desktop program and a mobile app that synchronize with each other.</p>
				<h3>Motivation</h3>
				<p>A long-term, grand idea that I have is to make a technology that can serve as a full-fledged personal
					assistant, similar to the AI Jarvis in the Marvel Iron Man movies. However, there are many
					technologies that are essential to Jarvis that is not yet advanced enough or have yet to be
					invented. That is why for now I want to only focus on developing one function of such a personal
					assistant: planning out the user’s day. Productivity in both the workplace and private lives is an
					important parameter for everyone. Everybody wants to have more time to do what is important to them.
					<strong>Dayli</strong> can help with that.</p>
				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>On a manual level, <strong>Dayli</strong> works much like a calendar app. Users can make new plans on
					a day, set a start time and and end time for the plan, and set the plan to be whether recurring or
					non-recurring. Each user will make an account, so it is possible for a user to view other users’
					calendars or share their calendar with other users. Users can mark which part of their calendar is
					private and which part is shareable.</p>
				<p>On the automation part, <strong>Dayli</strong> can make plans for the user. It can accomplish this
					task in many ways. <strong>Dayli</strong> can integrate itself with many other applications that
					already exists on a user’s phone or computer, such as emails, to-do lists and even other hardwares.
					For example, when <strong>Dayli</strong> integrates with a user’s email address, it can learn how
					many emails the user has received, learn how many are important based on past behaviors (something
					that all major email services like Gmail and Outlook has already implemented) and learn which one
					should be prioritized for replies. With the data, in the morning, <strong>Dayli</strong> can
					allocate a time slot for the user to read and reply to emails. Once the user is done dealing with
					emails, they can report it back to <strong>Dayli</strong> (by tapping a button that says “I’m done
					with this task”, for example). It can use this data to learn how much time the user needs each day
					for emails and adjust in the future to suit each user’s needs. <strong>Dayli</strong> can also make
					plans based on the content of the emails. The same can be done for to-do lists. Many people have a
					daily to-do list that they fill out in the morning or in the previous evening. If they use a list on
					an app, <strong>Dayli</strong> can integrate with the app to learn of these tasks. Based on their
					priorities, <strong>Dayli</strong> allocate time for these tasks.</p>
				<p>Scheduling is not limited to workplace tasks and can extend to the user’s own life e.g. a user may
					want to allocate a time in their day to spend with their family or significant other. The technology
					can even work with other hardware, or in other words, Internet of Things. For example, imagine a
					user uses a smart fridge that know how many eggs there is in the fridge. If the user runs out of
					eggs, <strong>Dayli</strong> can make it a plan for them to go the grocery store after work.</p>
				<p>The more a user use <strong>Dayli</strong>, the smarter the app become. If the user consistently uses
					less time for emails than the time <strong>Dayli</strong> allocate for them (and report to
					<strong>Dayli</strong> as such), for example, <strong>Dayli</strong> may allocate less time for
					daily emails in the future and vice versa. If the user continually uses <strong>Dayli</strong>, the
					app can learn of the users’ habits. Of course, the user is able to change the plans and time that
					<strong>Dayli</strong> have set for them. Do this enough times and <strong>Dayli</strong> will know
					to adjust to the users’ preferences. Ultimately, <strong>Dayli</strong> is all about making the
					users’ schedule work for them, not the other way around, automatically and without hidden functions.
				</p>
				<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
				<p><strong>Dayli</strong> can exists as both a mobile app and a web application/desktop application.
					These exists as separate apps but needs to be synced together with each user’s unique account. The
					Internet is an essential part. At the minimum level, there exists a backend AI/machine learning
					algorithm that continually learns the user’s usage of the app. One level up, it needs to be able to
					connect to other apps, make use of their data and integrate these into its own learning. As a
					software, it does not need any special hardwares, only those that a user would already own:
					computers and mobile phones. However, as an expanding technology, it may need advances from other
					products e.g. a fridge that knows how many eggs you have in it.</p>
				<h3>Skills Required</h3>
				<p>As a software product, the project needs software developers, including mobile developers, web
					developers and AI specialists. In particular, the main point of the app is the automation, therefore
					a good team of developers with good knowledge of AI is a must. These positions may be more difficult
					to fill since it is a specialized field and not as popular as other software positions. Another
					extremely important role, in my opinion, is user experience (UX) designers. As described, the app
					works the best the more data that the users allow to share with it. Therefore, it is impertinent
					that the app does not feel invasive to the users and provide a positive experience. Many other
					potential UX problems exist. A UX designer role is often seen as not as important as some other
					technical roles, so it may be difficult to fill these roles with excellent team members.</p>
				<h3>Outcome</h3>
				<p>Productivity is something that everyone wants to increase. It is important to prioritize tasks.
					Making plans with a calendar is one of the best ways to achieve this. However, the time spent
					prioritizing is time spent not actually being productive. The most productive thing a person can do
					is to simply do things. If <strong>Dayli</strong> is successful, it will eliminate the need for
					daily prioritizing; a user’s schedule will just work for them. Moreover, it does not just stop as
					scheduling app. The success of this app is a gateway to a bigger goal: true personal assistant. From
					that point, AI assistants could become more widespread and allow for development of AI assistants in
					other fields, such as in healthcare or commerce, which as of yet are only filled by humans.</p>

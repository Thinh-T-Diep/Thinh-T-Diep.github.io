				<h3>Hi, my name is Thinh T. Diep</h3>
				<p>My RMIT ID: 3825459 <br>
					And my email: s3825459@rmit.edu.vn</p>
				<h4>And here's a little something about myself</h4>
				<p>I am from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. This is my first semester in RMIT Vietnam.
					I can speak Vietnamese and English. <br>
					Two facts about myself: I have been learning the violin for about a year; I also compete (amateurly)
					in video games.
					The two games that I am currently playing the most are Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Autochess
					Mobile.</p>

			<!-- Aspriations -->
			<article id="aspirations">
				<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/mmbn-background.jpg" alt="Megaman Battle Network" /></span>
				<h5>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?
					Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if
					any).</h5>
				<p>The above picture can sum up my inspirations and aspirations since childhood. </p>
				<p>The topic I find the most interesting in information technology and computer science is artificial
					intelligence, specifically natural language processing, humanlike robots and sentient AI. My
					interest in these topics started in my childhood. I used to play a video game series on my computer
					named <em>Mega Man Battle Network </em> (using a Gameboy Advance simulator). Those games have the
					players switch between playing as a young boy and his partner, a sentient AI human avatar in a
					computer world, and fight villains to save the world. In this game world, AI is an indispensible
					part of life and every person has a personal assistant similar to the aforementioned main character
					that helps with his or her daily life. They can even converse just like a human would and be a close
					friend. The games made a huge impact on me and ever since I have always wanted to make such a
					technology a reality. I am also a fan of read books and movies that explore similar ideas, such as
					those from author <a
						href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36402034-do-androids-dream-of-electric-sheep">Philip
						K. Dick</a>
					and director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_(film)">Steven
						Spielberg</a>.</p>

				<h5>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h5>
				<p>RMIT is my top choice for a university in Vietnam for several reasons. Firstly, it is an
					English-speaking campus, where I can improve my English greatly and English skill is an important
					skill that employers seek nowadays. Secondly, it has a large body of international students of
					different cultures and backgrounds whom I can learn from since they have different points of view.
					Thirdly, it is an international school whose programs are accredited by recognized organizations,
					which means my degree would be recognized in many places around the world should I choose to pursue
					a career in different country than Vietnam.</p>
				<h5>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h5>
				<p>I have a few expectations for the course. I want to learn enough about the different topics within IT
					to be able to figure out what exactly I want to do in the future. I want to be able to have a clear
					view of my ideal job and have an idea of how to get there. I want to know that, for the career that
					I choose, whether that I should work after I graduate or I should pursue further education in form
					of a Honors Degree, Master Degree and/or PhD Degree. I want to learn where in the world I should go
					to have the best environment for my career. I want to explore a project that I am passionate about
					and have an idea of how to create it. I want to learn the skills or at least know what skills I need
					to learn to be able to do such a project. Lastly, I would want to reaffirm my interest in IT and
					computer science.

				<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>

				<h4>
					<a href="https://jobs.lever.co/openai/588c1d80-4632-4d5c-a535-9f2c8c80c501">Job Posting</a>
					<p style="display: inline;"> (<a href="https://imgur.com/5yrtUEK">Alternate Link</a>)</p>
				</h4>
				<p>The position is a research position at OpenAI, a company whose mission is creating AI technology that
					are both open-source and beneficial to humankind. The ultimate goal of OpenAI is building artificial
					general intelligence (AGI), meaning AI that has the same capability of intelligence as humans. The
					company consists of many research teams focusing on different aspects of AGI. The job description
					itself is actually quite vague, however it still excites me for many reasons. Firstly, the company’s
					mission aligns quite close to the area of AI I want to focus on in my career e.g. humanlike
					conversational AI. Secondly, even though it’s a research position, it is a position in industry,
					instead of academia where there is a large degree of politics governing researchers. Thirdly, I
					myself want to build something that can be immediately useful to all people, rather than doing
					research and writing papers that are read by only a few people, and industry provides a better
					opportunity in doing this than academia.</p>
				<p>The skills, qualifications and experience as described in the posting is, again, quite vague.
					However, there is a few things that may be implied in the posting. AI is a field that requires high
					skill and education, even more so for a researcher. Therefore, a PhD degree in computer science may
					be required, or at least a Master’s degree. They also want candidates to show a track records of
					authoring papers or projects. It is also mentioned that the company have a culture of creativity in
					AI. The projects that the company is pursuing are open-source, therefore ideal candidates would be
					those who have participated in such projects.</p>
				<p>At the moment, I am an undergraduate student at RMIT in the IT program. I have taken classes in
					programming and computer science and have gotten excellent grades in those classes. I have
					participated in a mentorship program where I have to do research within a team and done a
					presentation at the end. I am confident in my skills in programming and my skill to further learn
					subjects related to IT and computer science.</p>
				<p>In my opinion, the first step towards obtaining all that I need for the ideal job is to complete the
					RMIT Vietnam IT program with a high GPA. I aim to have a 4.0 GPA. During my time here at RMIT, I
					should participate in research and side projects that can showcase my skills and my interest in the
					AI field. After obtaining the Bachelor of IT, I will go to RMIT in Melbourne, Australia and study to
					get the Honors Bachelor of Computer Science. With that second Honors Bachelor, I will apply for a
					PhD program, perhaps in the United States or in an English-speaking country. During all this time, I
					will participate in more research and projects. I am also interested in the entrepreneur world,
					therefore building and making something of my own is something that I will constantly be doing.</p>
